Description: Generate URLs for pages of search results from Google Scholar 
    using combinations of AND, OR, '"", and NOT Boolean operators and syntax,
    along with title only searches, patent and citation searches, and author, 
    year and source fields (as provided by the full Advanced search facility).
    Functions also exist to download all given pages of search results from 
    these URLs, and then locally scrape citation information from within them.
