#' Download one results page as html file
#'
#' @description Downloads one page of Google Scholar search results from a URLs as html files with
#' a specific wait-time to avoid IP address blocking.
#' @param url One URLs corresponding to a page of search results.
#' @param pause Integer specifying the number of seconds to wait between download attempts. The
#' default value is 4 seconds.
#' @param backoff A logical argument (TRUE or FALSE) specifying whether responsive backing-off should be used.
#' If set to TRUE, the time between calls is varied depending on how long the server takes to respond to the
#' original request. The responsive back-off time is set to multiple the response time by the `pause` time: i.e.
#' if the system takes 1.02 seconds to respond and `pause` time is set to 4 seconds, a 4.10 second delay will
#' be employed before the next call. The default for back-off is `FALSE`.
